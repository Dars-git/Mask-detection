# Face Mask Detection System

A web application for real-time face mask detection. This project uses deep learning and computer vision to identify whether a person is wearing a mask.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV
- Mask/No-Mask classification using a trained CNN model
- Web-based interface using Django
- Visual feedback with bounding boxes and labels

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Django
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Dars-git/mask-detection.git
cd mask-detection
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the dependencies
```
